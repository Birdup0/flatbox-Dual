This is a fork of the flatbox-rev5 with a extra button that can be bound to either jump or another buttons through GP2040CE web configuration.

it fits both V1 and V2 choc low profile switches with hot-swap sockets.


The building process is almost 1:1 as with the flatbox rev5 with only needing one more hotswap socket and switch.
