![Flatbox-Dual](https://github.com/Birdup0/flatbox-Dual/assets/141259641/aa2f7d43-78aa-4356-8388-af31ebcd459e)



This is a fork of the flatbox-rev5 with redesigned pcb and case for a extra jump button that can be mapped into another action using GP2040 firmware.
it fits both V1 and V2 choc low profile switches. 
# Warning #
This will be temporary repo and as I fully confirm that the case will fit with hot swaps it will be migrated to the open stick community hardware repo with the Bom and CPL files.
