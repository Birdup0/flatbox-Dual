This is a fork of the flatbox with redesigned pcb and case for a extra jump button that can be mapped into another action using GP2040 firmware.
Currently haven't tested the case and as such there is a chance of misalignment or that the hotswap may not fit.
When the final build is finished i will update the repo with all required info
